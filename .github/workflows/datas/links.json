        "title": "Hayek Summer Workshop (Leipzig 2018)",
        "description": "Financial crises, skyrocketing debt levels, sluggish growth, and growing inequality are among the most pressing policy issues in the industrialized world. The Hayek Summer Workshop provides an opportunity to fifteen selected students to discuss causes, consequences, and remedies of the current low-growth and high debt environment from a Hayekian and Public Choice perspective. Students will spend two full days learning, thinking and arguing about topics such as the link between monetary policy, credit cycles and financial crises. They will explore the political economy of crisis policies as well as unintended consequences of crisis management. The intensive workshop takes place from September 5-7, 2018 at Leipzig University, amidst one of Germany’s youngest and most dynamic cities. Selected students will be accommodated right in the city center, two minutes from the university buildings. The program package also includes welcome drinks, lunch meals, and get-togethers with the instructors.",

        "description": "The Mises University is the world's leading instructional program in the Austrian School of economics. Since 1986, it has been the essential training ground for economists who are looking beyond the mainstream. The program offers courses and seminars on the whole range of the discipline. A core curriculum presents economic foundations, and more than fifty elective classes explore the entire range of economics, in all levels of advancement. The program ends with a Mündliche Prüfung, an optional exam for an honors certificate and cash prizes for the most learned. Subject areas cover market behavior, competition, value and utility, money and banking, business cycles, industrial organization, method, economic history, the philosophy of science, financial economics, and more. You attend what most suits your interests and level of advancement. Classes are interspersed with discussion seminars, faculty panels, and plenary lectures. There are special sessions on economic history, economics and ethics, and political philosophy. Nightly social hours allow time to meet and discuss it all with faculty and other students.",

Our goal is to create an educational and community-driven event with high-profile speakers from all around the world and with different backgrounds — from technical engineers and cybersecurity professionals to business owners and bestselling authors. The Baltic Honeybadger conference is driven by the cypherpunk movement. We're not promoting various so called altcoins, ICOs, banks and other blockchain-based 'snake oil'. Join us in Riga and learn more about the honeybadger of money - Bitcoin. HODL!"

Not everyone has the skills to take full advantage of what Bitcoin has to offer, so this event will help the average user be more familiar with best practices and understanding all aspects of interacting with the Bitcoin network. There will be practical hands on presentations of how to set up features, along with theoretical discussions removing the FUD and misconceptions surrounding the current state of Bitcoin’s Trustless Network.",

        "description": "This pioneering work by Jörg Guido Hülsmann, professor of economics at the University of Angers in France and the author of Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, is the first full study of a critically important issue today: the ethics of money production. By 'money production,'' the author is speaking not in the colloquial sense of the phrase 'making money,'' but rather the actual production of money as a commodity in the whole economic life. The choice of the money we use in exchange is not something that needs to be established and fixed by government. In fact, his thesis is that a government monopoly on money production and management has no ethical or economic grounding at all. Legal tender laws, bailout guarantees, tax-backed deposit insurance, and the entire apparatus that sustains national monetary systems, has been wholly unjustified. Money, he argues, should be a privately produced good like any other, such as clothing or food."

He tells a thrilling story because he loves the subject so much. Max simply replaces the word 'gold' with 'Bitcoin' showing how Rothbard has predicted all major events of Bitcoin in 1963."

Many of the principles in this document are applicable to other smart card devices. Keys stored on YubiKey are non-exportable (as opposed to file-based keys that are stored on disk) and are convenient for everyday use. Instead of having to remember and enter passphrases to unlock SSH/GPG keys, YubiKey needs only a physical touch after being unlocked with a PIN code. All signing and encryption operations happen on the card, rather than in OS memory.",

        "title": "Understanding Schnorr Signatures",
        "description": "Bitcoin has traditionally used ECDSA signatures over the secp256k1 curve for authenticating transactions. These are standardized, but have a number of downsides compared to Schnorr signatures over the same curve: - Security proof: The security of Schnorr signatures is easily provable in the random oracle model assuming the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is hard. Such a proof does not exist for ECDSA. - Non-malleability: ECDSA signatures are inherently malleable; a third party without access to the private key can alter an existing valid signature for a given public key and message into another signature that is valid for the same key and message. This issue is discussed in BIP62 and BIP66. On the other hand, Schnorr signatures are provably non-malleable. - Linearity: Schnorr signatures have the remarkable property that multiple parties can collaborate to produce a signature that is valid for the sum of their public keys. This is the building block for various higher-level constructions that improve efficiency and privacy, such as multisignatures and others."

BIP39 based, which means you can backup the secret words onto paper, and have lots of sub-accounts and unlimited independent payment addresses. It knows how to understand transactions, so you can see what you are approving. The first PSBT (BIP 174) native wallet which can be used completely offline for it's entire lifecycle. BUT IT'S DIFFERENT! NO specialized software required. It accepts standard PSBT transaction (BIP 174) stored on an MicroSD card. NO companion 'app' on your computer, works with the major wallets already (Electrum, and more to come). It's cheap! Simple packaging, plain design, no fancy boxes, no redundant cables. It's ultrasecure! Real crypto security chip. Your private key is stored in a dedicated security chip, not the main micro's flash. Easy back-up! MicroSD card slot for backup and data storage. This allows truly offline signing, by transferring the unsigned/signed transactions on sneakernet. Open source software design runs Micropython and you can change it. OTHER FEATURES: Full-sized numeric keypad makes entering PIN easy and quick. Larger 128x64 OLED screen. It's an open platform, and we expect other ˛\"apps\" in time, like: Sign text messages to prove control over private key. Participate in multisig wallets, with other signers. Encrypt/decrypt secret messages (stored on MicroSD or otherwise)."
