    "content": "NWS works with and without encrypted transport. There are lots of different flavors to explore. \n\nWhen used without encryption, the entry node must be run by the user themselves because public entry nodes would be able to listen in otherwise. Two options in those cases: run the entry node locally in tandem with your (unmodified) client, or skip the entry node and modify the client so that data is sent through nostr to the exit node directly (the client is the entry node).\n\nWhen used with encryption, the entry node can also be public. If the encryption doesn't rely on certificate authorities, it just works. You have to make sure you're talking to the right person, but that problem is as old as computer science. For example, ssh will ask you to confirm the fingerprint of the server when you connect.\n\nIf the encryption is https and the certificate was issued for a normal domain, your browser will complain (do you trust this website?) and the user will have to say \"let me pass, even if insecure\". Without ugly hacks (issuing your own root cert for example), I don't know ways to circumvent this. Note that Tor services doen't support https and they don't have to since transport is always Sphinx-encrypted (even hidden from the entry node).\n\nHow do you make sure you're talking to the right server if you use https? Couldn't the entry node just send your traffic somewhete else? We can actually do something that is unique to Nostr here: the exit node can publish its own TLS certificate on nostr and sign it. That's right, you don't need an authority to do that for you if you remain within the NWS system. Clients can fetch the cert from nostr before talking to the entry node and verify against that cert. \n\nHere is another cool part that we haven't talked about yet: the exit node can also be configured to reach the global Internet and not only a local service (we call this NWS v2). In those cases, NWS can be used a bit like a VPN. You can type \"https google dot com\" in your browser and your encrypted traffic would flow from your machine to the entry node, to the exit node, then to Google and back to you. on those cases, nobody complains about the certificate because everything is fine.\n\n\nExciting shit.

    "content": "These details should tell you that if you consider these types of groups (sophisticated adversaries with limitless physical access) as a part of your threat model, then you should:\n\n- Use the most recent phone you possibly can\n\n- Upgrade your phone to the newest possible generation as soon as possible after release if you can help it.\n\n- Use the latest version of GrapheneOS ASAP. Do not delay.\n\n- Use a strong, high entropy passphrase to make bruteforcing the device credential impossible if secure element is ever exploited.\n\n- Set GrapheneOS auto reboot time accordingly so encrypted data goes back at rest when the phone reboots, which makes AFU exploitation impossible. The lower the better.\n\n- Enable duress password. Set it to something easy to trigger but not easy to misfire.\n\n- Turn your phone off in a high risk situation, and trigger duress when in a duress situation.\n\n- Disable your radios when not using them (turn off Wi-Fi, use airplane mode, disable NFC, UWB etc.) for attack surface reduction.\n\n- Set an appropriate USB port control or disable the USB port so they aren't able to connect a device to it.\n\n- Use user profiles (application data and user files within profiles are stored encrypted with separate credentials).\n\n- Enable upcoming GrapheneOS security features like second factor authentication unlock when they come out.\n\n- Communicate only over secure messaging. Some apps like Molly (Signal fork) have features to encrypt the app storage with a passphrase, which access to that app's data impossible even when a profile is compromised  providing the passphrase is secure enough.\n\n- Become disassociated to data. Learn to only keep files or other data as long as it is necessary. If you have no use for them for a long time, then back it up elsewhere, encrypted. Delete anything you don't have a use for in the present. Your data is not your memories. \n\n- Remember that you are only as secure as the people you trust.

    "content": "# A Declaration of Separation\n\n## To The Governments & People of Earth:\n\nWe claim the right to exist, and we will defend it. We do not seek to overthrow anything. We do not seek to control anything. We/merely wish to be left alone.\n\nAll we ever wanted was to live in peace with our friends and neighbors. For a long, long time we bore insults to our liberty; we took blows, we did what we could to avoid injury and we worked through the system to get the offenses to stop. That has now changed. \n\nWe no longer see any benefit in working through the world?s systems. At some point, working within a system becomes cowardly and immoral; for us, that point has arrived.\n\nRegardless of the parties in power, their governments have continued to restrict, restrain and punish us. We hereby reject them all. We hereby withdraw from them all. We hold the ruling states of this world and all that appertains to them to be self-serving and opposed to humanity. We now withdraw our obedience and reclaim the right to strike back when struck. We will not initiate force, but we do reserve the right to answer it. We did not choose this ? it was forced upon us.\n\n## To The Governments of Earth:\n\nYou are building cages for all that is human. In the name of protection, you have intruded into all areas of human life, far exceeding the reach of any Caesar. You claim ultimate control of our property and our decisions, of our travels and even our identities. You claim ownership of humanity far beyond the dreams of any Emperor of any previous era.\n\nUnderstand clearly: We reject your authority and we reject your legitimacy. We do not believe that you have any right to do the things you do. You have massive power, but no right to impose it upon us and no legitimacy. We have forsaken you. We are no longer your citizens or your subjects. Your systems are inherently anti-human, even if all their operators are not. We are not merely angry young people. We are fathers and mothers; aunts, uncles and grandparents; we are business owners and trusted employees; we are mechanics and engineers and farmers. We are nurses and accountants and students and executives.\n\nWe are on every continent.\n\nThis is not a burst of outrage; this is a sober declaration that we no longer accept unearned suffering as our role in life. \n\nFor long decades we sat quietly, hoping that things would turn around. We took no actions; we suffered along with everyone else. But after having our limits pushed back again and again, we have given up on your systems. If our fellow inhabitants of this planet wish to accept your rule, they are free to do so. \n\nWe will not try to stop them. We, however, will no longer accept your constraints upon us. \n\nFrom now on, when you hurt us, we will bite back. If you leave us alone we will leave you alone and you can continue to rule your subjects. We are happy to live quietly. But if you come after us, there will be consequences. You caused this because of your fetish for control and power. The chief men and women among you are pathologically driven to control everyone and everything that moves upon this planet. You have made yourselves the judge of every human activity. No god-king of the ancient world ever had the power that your systems do.\n\nYou have created a world where only the neutered are safe and where only outlaws are free.\n\n## To The People of Earth:\n\nWe seek nothing from you. We do not want to rule you and we do not want to control you.\n\nAll we wish is to live on earth in peace. As always, we will be helpful neighbors and generous acquaintances. We will remain honest business partners and trustworthy employees. We will continue to be loving parents and respectful children.\n\nWe will not, however, be sacrificial animals. We reject the idea that others have a right to our lives and our property. We will not demand anything from you, and we will no longer acquiesce to any demands upon us. We have left that game. We reject all obligations to any person or organization beyond honesty, fair dealing and a respect for human life. \n\nWe will shortly explain what we believe, but we are not demanding that you agree with us. All we ask is that you do not try to stop us. Continue to play the game if you wish; we will not try to disrupt it. We have merely walked away from it. \n\nWe wish you peace. \n\n## To Those Who Will Condemn Us: \n\nWe will ignore you. \n\nWe welcome and seek the verdict of a just God, before whom we are willing to expose our innermost thoughts. Are you similarly willing? We would stand openly before all mankind if it were not suicidal. Perhaps some day we will have to accept slaughter for our crime of independence, but not yet. \n\nYour criticism and your malice are much deeper than mere disagreements of strategy or philosophy. You do not oppose our philosophy, you oppose our existence. Our presence in the world means that your precious ideals are false. Some of you would rather kill us than face the loss of your ideologies, just as those like you have either hated or killed every sufficiently independent human. \n\nYou present yourselves to the world as compassionate, tolerant and enlightened, but we know that your smooth words are costumes. Oh yes, we know you, servant of the state; don't forget, we were raised with you. We played with you in the schoolyard, we sat next to you in the classroom. Some of us studied at the same elite universities. We watched as you had your first tastes of power. We were the boys and girls standing next to you. Some of us were your first victims. We are not fooled by your carefully crafted public image. \n\n## What We Believe\n\n1: Many humans resent the responsibilities that are implied by consciousness. We accept those responsibilities and we embrace consciousness. Rather than letting things happen to us (avoiding consciousness), we accept consciousness and choose to act in our own interest. We do not seek the refuge of blaming others, neither do we take refuge in crowds. We are willing to act on our personal judgment, and we are willing to accept the consequences thereof. \n\n2: We believe in negative rights for all: That all humans should be free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not intrude upon others; that no man has a right to the life, liberty or property of another; that we oppose aggression, fraud and coercion. \n\n3: We do not believe that our way of life, or any other, will make life perfect or trouble-free. We expect crime and disagreements and ugliness, and we are prepared to deal with them. We do not seek a strongman to step in and solve problems for us. We agree to see to them ourselves.\n\n4: We believe in free and unhindered commerce. So long as exchanges are voluntary and honest, no other party has a right to intervene before, during or after. \n\n5: We believe that all individuals should keep their agreements. \n\n6: We believe that honestly obtained property is fully legitimate and absolute. \n\n7: We believe that some humans are evil and that they must be faced and dealt with. We accept the fact that this is a difficult area of life. \n\n8: We believe that humans can self-organize effectively. We expect them to cooperate. We reject impositions of hierarchy and organization. \n\n9: We believe that all humans are to be held as equals in all matters regarding justice. \n\n10: We believe that the more a man or woman cares about right and wrong, the more of a threat he or she is perceived to be by governments. \n\n11: We believe that there are only two true classes of human beings: Those who wish to exercise power upon others either directly or through intermediaries and those who have no such desires. \n\n12: Large organizations and centralization are inherently anti-human. They must rely upon rules rather than principles, treating humans within the organization as obedient tools.\n\n## Our Plans:\n\n(We are building our own society. We will supplement traditional tools with networking, cryptography, sound money, digital currency and anonymous messaging. Our society will not be centrally controlled. It will rely solely\non voluntary arrangements. \n\nWe welcome others to join us. We are looking for people who are independent creators of value, people who act more than talk, and people who do the right thing because it is the right thing. \n\nWe will develop our own methods of dealing with injustice, built on the principles of negative rights, restitution, integrity and equal justice. We do not forbid anyone from having one foot in each realm - ours and the old realm - although we demand that they do no damage to our realm. We are fully opposed to any use of our realm to facilitate crime in the old realm, such as the hiding of criminal proceeds. \n\nWe expect to be loudly condemned, libeled and slandered by the authorities of the old regime.

With NWS, you can host any existing web application on Nostr without having to use DNS or even announce your public IP to the world, simply by sharing your service's npub (or nprofile).\n\nTry it out the demo yourself. Here is a Cashu test mint running with NWS. Let's use curl to retrieve the mint's information. The request travels from your computer to the public NWS entry relay, then through nostr to the service's NWS exit relay. At the other end is a Cashu mint with HTTPS encryption.\n\n```\ncurl -s -x socks5h://relay.8333.space:8882 https://nprofile1qqs8a8nk09fhrxylcd42haz8ev4cprhnk5egntvs0whafvaaxpk8plgpzemhxue69uhhyetvv9ujuwpnxvejuumsv93k2g6k9kr/v1/info --insecure | jq\n```\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTMl.png \n\nI can't stress this enough: THE MINT RUNS BEHIND HTTPS!\n\nThe NWS entry relay can't read your traffic. It's encrypted. We can host public entry relays that can be used by anyone.\n\nThis means we can plug the entire internet to it üåê.\n\nLet's plug it into Cashu for now. Nutshell wallet supports socks5 proxies (that's how it uses Tor). By setting the public entry relay as the proxy, the wallet can now connect to a mint's npub/nprofile and communicate with it via NWS.\n\nhttps://m.primal.net/JTot.png \n\nThis is going to be so freaking cool. And it's going to be a lot more useful than just for Cashu. There are still bugs and issues that need to be ironed out but the code is coming out soon. Watch this space.",

    "content": "#dev #CLN\n\nI've spent the last few workdays completely reworking our onion message code.  This was scattered in various places and I wanted to unify it, and also written several years ago and I'd forgotten how the protocol actually works!\n\nonion messages are *double* encrypted; this is the main source of confusion!  At the high layer, they're a series of nested encrypted calls (\"onionmsg_tlv\" in the BOLT 4 spec), so each recipient decrypts and hands it on: this is exactly the same as we use for payment information.  But inside that is *another* encrypted blob (onionmsg_tlv.encrypted_recipient_data), which requires a tweak which was handed to you alongside the onion, for you to decrypt (into an \"encrypted_data_tlv\").  Inside that is all the information about where to send next, any restrictions, and allows you to calculate the *next* tweak to hand on (it can also override the next tweak).\n\nThe double encryption is necessary because there are *three* actors here: Alice wants Bob to send her a message, without revealing her identity. So she gives Bob a \"blinded path\" which goes via Charlie: this path contains Charlie's pubkey (where to start the path), a blinding tweak, and two encrypted blobs for Alice to put into each layer of the onion message.  The first an encrypted blob which Charlie can read, which contains her pubkey so he knows where to send it next.  The second is her own, and contains a secret specific to the purpose of this message, so Bob can't play games trying to use this blinded path for anything else (\"hey, are you the same node as this previous payment?\") or use a different blinded path for this purpose.  She can also add dummy hops (we don't yet), which she will simply absorb, to obscure the path length from Bob.  You can add padding to make the hops indistinguishable (we don't yet).\n\nBob puts the actual stuff he wants to send Alice into the final onion call (often including his own blinded reply path!), along with the encrypted blob.\n\nImportantly, even if Bob were sending a message *not through a blinded path* he would use the same double-encrypted format: that's so Charlie can't tell whether a blinded path is being used or not, even though it's slightly less efficient.  Crypto is cheap these days, too.\n\nNow, if Alice gives Bob a blinded path to Charlie and Charlie is Bob's peer, he can simply send the onion and the first blinding tweak to Charlie.  But if Alice needs to send the message via Dave to Charlie, she needs to prepend a step.  That's not quite possible, naively, because blinding tweaks are generated *forwards*, and she needs Charlie to get the right blinding tweak from Dave, and Alice has no way of making that happen.  So inside Dave's encrypted blob, she uses next_blinding_override to tell Dave to hand that blinding override to Charlie instead of the normal one.  I just implemented this for Core Lightning (previously we would simply connect to the first node, which is privacy-compromising and should only be done as a last resort).\n\nThese blinded paths have some nice properties: you can't use part of them (you don't know the blinding factor except for the first one, so you can't start in the middle, and you can't replace any data), you need to use all of them.  They can contain timelimits to avoid easy probing, too: a classic measure would be to see if the path fails when a given node is down, but that takes time.  The spec insists all errors within the blinded path are the same, and originate from the entry: this loses some analytical power on failure, but makes probing harder.  The entry point is supposed to add a random delay (we don't yet!).  There may still be implementation differences, but they're hard for Bob to probe (and Alice doesn't need to, as she set up the path).\n",
