The Hayek Summer Workshop provides an opportunity to fifteen selected students to discuss causes, consequences, and remedies of the current low-growth and high debt environment from a Hayekian and Public Choice perspective. Students will spend two full days learning, thinking and arguing about topics such as the link between monetary policy, credit cycles and financial crises. They will explore the political economy of crisis policies as well as unintended consequences of crisis management. The intensive workshop takes place from September 5-7, 2018 at Leipzig University, amidst one of Germany’s youngest and most dynamic cities. Selected students will be accommodated right in the city center, two minutes from the university buildings. The program package also includes welcome drinks, lunch meals, and get-togethers with the instructors.",

    "description": "This pioneering work by Jörg Guido Hülsmann, professor of economics at the University of Angers in France and the author of Mises: The Last Knight of Liberalism, is the first full study of a critically important issue today: the ethics of money production. By 'money production,'' the author is speaking not in the colloquial sense of the phrase 'making money,'' but rather the actual production of money as a commodity in the whole economic life. The choice of the money we use in exchange is not something that needs to be established and fixed by government. In fact, his thesis is that a government monopoly on money production and management has no ethical or economic grounding at all. Legal tender laws, bailout guarantees, tax-backed deposit insurance, and the entire apparatus that sustains national monetary systems, has been wholly unjustified. Money, he argues, should be a privately produced good like any other, such as clothing or food.",

Keys stored on YubiKey are non-exportable (as opposed to file-based keys that are stored on disk) and are convenient for everyday use. Instead of having to remember and enter passphrases to unlock SSH/GPG keys, YubiKey needs only a physical touch after being unlocked with a PIN code. All signing and encryption operations happen on the card, rather than in OS memory.",

    "description": "Bitcoin has traditionally used ECDSA signatures over the secp256k1 curve for authenticating transactions. These are standardized, but have a number of downsides compared to Schnorr signatures over the same curve: - Security proof: The security of Schnorr signatures is easily provable in the random oracle model assuming the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) is hard. Such a proof does not exist for ECDSA. - Non-malleability: ECDSA signatures are inherently malleable; a third party without access to the private key can alter an existing valid signature for a given public key and message into another signature that is valid for the same key and message. This issue is discussed in BIP62 and BIP66. On the other hand, Schnorr signatures are provably non-malleable. - Linearity: Schnorr signatures have the remarkable property that multiple parties can collaborate to produce a signature that is valid for the sum of their public keys. This is the building block for various higher-level constructions that improve efficiency and privacy, such as multisignatures and others.",

BIP39 based, which means you can backup the secret words onto paper, and have lots of sub-accounts and unlimited independent payment addresses. It knows how to understand transactions, so you can see what you are approving. The first PSBT (BIP 174) native wallet which can be used completely offline for it's entire lifecycle. BUT IT'S DIFFERENT! NO specialized software required. It accepts standard PSBT transaction (BIP 174) stored on an MicroSD card. NO companion 'app' on your computer, works with the major wallets already (Electrum, and more to come). It's cheap! Simple packaging, plain design, no fancy boxes, no redundant cables. It's ultrasecure! Real crypto security chip. Your private key is stored in a dedicated security chip, not the main micro's flash. Easy back-up! MicroSD card slot for backup and data storage. This allows truly offline signing, by transferring the unsigned/signed transactions on sneakernet. Open source software design runs Micropython and you can change it. OTHER FEATURES: Full-sized numeric keypad makes entering PIN easy and quick. Larger 128x64 OLED screen. It's an open platform, and we expect other ˛\"apps\" in time, like: Sign text messages to prove control over private key. Participate in multisig wallets, with other signers. Encrypt/decrypt secret messages (stored on MicroSD or otherwise).",
